 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
 * s consists of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and ' '.
 * s represents a valid expression.
 * '+' is not used as a unary operation (i.e., "+1" and "+(2 + 3)" is invalid).
 * '-' could be used as a unary operation (i.e., "-1" and "-(2 + 3)" is valid).
 * There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
 * Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.
 *
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
